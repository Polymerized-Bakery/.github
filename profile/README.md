# Polymerized Bakery 
The bakery for short, Is a organization of dumb modders using the Polymer api to create serverside mods akin to plugins

## Why??
Boredom mostly, also plugins pissed us off too many times.

i mean seriously...40$ for a plugin that a month later you barely rwrite and then charge 60$ for the new one what the fuck

## What have you made
read the github and youll find out, youre already reading this just look over a few hundred pixels


### Can i join the bakery?
We are willing to let people upload mods under the bakery name just reachout and contact us.
